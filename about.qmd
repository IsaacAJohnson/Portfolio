I making a career pivot, and working on something I have wanted to do for a long time.  Currently enrolled at Willamette Univeristy in their Master's of Data Science program, and am expecting to graduate this August '23. Previously I worked in healthcare as a medical and pharmaceutical sales representative.  Through that I got to learn many aspects of working in healthcare very thoroughly, including health insurance, formularies, prior authorizations, managed care plans, communicating with doctors, staff, and many other stakeholders. 

more to come.....
